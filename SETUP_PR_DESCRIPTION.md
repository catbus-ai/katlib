# Add Comprehensive Setup Tools and Step-by-Step Slack Guide

## Overview
This PR adds essential setup tools and crystal-clear instructions to make deploying the Katbus Slack onboarding system much easier for managers and administrators.

## 🎯 Problem Solved
The original implementation was complete but lacked clear setup guidance, causing confusion about:
- What users need to do personally vs what the system handles automatically
- Exact steps for creating Slack apps with specific UI elements to click
- How to obtain and configure the 3 required tokens
- Quick verification that everything is set up correctly

The new setup process integrates seamlessly:
1. **Manager runs** `python quick_start.py` (validates everything)
2. **Creates Slack app** following SLACK_SETUP_GUIDE.md (5 minutes)
3. **Tests with demo data** using `python demo_data.py`
4. **Launches system** and starts employee onboarding
5. **Monitors progress** on dashboard with real-time updates

## 🎉 Ready for Production

This PR makes the Katbus Slack onboarding system:
- **Enterprise-ready** with proper setup validation
