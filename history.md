## Katbus the company history:

Founded in 2021 by Shay, Katbus began as a passion project to help her daughters learn to code. The idea for Katlib was inspired by the endless KATSEYE Gnarly dance-a-thons at home. 

What started as a simple Mad Libs game in Python quickly evolved into a full-fledged educational platform. The company's name "Katbus" is a playful combination of "KATSEYE" and "Catbus," because we love K-Pop and Studio Ghibli. Why-not?!

In our first year, we focused on developing the core Katlib game, working with a small team of educators and developers. By 2022, we had launched our first web version and began collaborating with schools to test the platform. Today, Katbus is a growing team of 6 passionate individuals dedicated to making coding education more accessible and fun.

## Mission:
To inspire the next generation of creators by making coding education as exciting as a K-pop concert. We believe that learning to code should be as engaging as your favorite song, and that every young person deserves the chance to express their creativity through technology.

## Vision:
To become the world's most engaging platform for creative coding education, where students don't just learn to code â€“ they learn to create stories, express themselves, and build the digital world of tomorrow.
