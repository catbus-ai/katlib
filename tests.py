ðŸŽ’ Chapter 1: Arrival in Seoul

Luna and Mia landed in Seoul with their bags stuffed full of lightsticks, extra phone chargers, and emergency ramen packs. They were feeling super excited, because tonight was the big KATSEYE concert at the magical GlowBop Arena. The entire airport was buzzing with fans holding banners that said, "WE LOVE YOU, SOPHIA!"

They got lost trying to find their hotel and accidentally walked into a store that only sold robotic alpacas. One of the alpacas made a loud squeak and scared Mia so badly she dropped her glowstick in a fountain. A security guard offered them directions... but only if they could do the crab dance perfectly.

ðŸ•º Chapter 2: The Concert Mayhem

At the arena, a mysterious glitter cannon exploded near their seats and showered the crowd with confetti shaped like âœ¨. Luna screamed so loud, even Sophia looked confused for a second. During the encore, the music stopped and the stage lights turned off. A voice over the speakers said, "We need two brave fans to save the show!"

Without thinking, Mia leapt onto the stage, armed with her lightstick and Luna behind her. The crowd chanted their names, and someone handed them microphones made of cotton candy.

ðŸ’« Chapter 3: Legends of the Night

They performed a chaotic freestyle that included the crab dance, moonwalking with a ramen in each hand, and dramatic slow-motion karaoke. Somehow, it worked. The stage lights came back on, Sophia hugged them both, and confetti exploded in every direction.

As they walked back to their hotelâ€”now minor celebritiesâ€”they looked at each other and said, "This was the most excited day of our lives." And in that exact moment, a fan ran up to them and whispered, "Are you the girls from the glitter cannon incident?"

Legendary. âœ¨
